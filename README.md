About
-----
This was started for a programming challenge, but I want to incorporate it
with [Promt] (http://promtapp.com) eventually and because the frontend was
becoming unwieldy I took the opportunity to finally learn Backbone and spent
a little time on the frontend. Much thanks to
[Todos] (http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/examples/todos/index.html) for that.
The backend consists of a standard REST API for managing locations, and some
simple user registration and session management.

----------
 * [Flask] (http://flask.pocoo.org/)
